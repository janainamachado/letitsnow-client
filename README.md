## Why: 

As a brazilian born and raised in the always sunny Rio de Janeiro, once I moved to Europe, all I wanted was to chase the snow every winter. But I didn't find an app that would give me the precisely information that I wanted, nor the way I wanted, so I've decided to create one. Developers, huh? 
The main focus of the app is simple: showing you where it is snowing at the moment so you can plan your winter trip ❄️
