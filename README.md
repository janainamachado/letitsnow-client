## Why: 

As a brazilian born and raised in the always sunny Rio de Janeiro, once I moved to Europe, all I wanted was to chase the snow every winter. But I didn't find an app that would give me the precisely information that I wanted, nor the way I wanted, so I've decided to create one. Developers, huh? 
The main focus of the app is simple: showing you where is it snowing at the moment so you can plan your winter trip ❄️ 


## Key features 

- The app displays a list of the cities where it's snowing;
- It also display the markers on the map with the locations;
- Once you click in a city in the city list, the map provides the fly to feature;

## Working on

- Implementing the functionality to filter the results by country;

- Improve the UI/UX;
